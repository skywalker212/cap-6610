# Generative Model Comparison: GANs and VAEs on MNIST Dataset

This repository contains the code, data, LaTeX source, and serialized model files related to the research project on comparing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for generating handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

Source code is available in `src/` directory. Final report is available in `final-report/` directory. All the other directory starting with `report-*` contain intermediate reports. Directories starting with `assignment-*` contain homework assignments.
